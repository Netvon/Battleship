### Install
To get the project to run you first need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). The project uses a number of node modules.
* Gulp
* Sass
* Browserify
* Babel

After installing Node run `npm install` in the project root folder to install those dependencies.

### Build
To create the compiled version of all the project's Javascript and Sass run `gulp` in the root. This will continuously compile both JavaScript and Sass.
