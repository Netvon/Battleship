### Install
To get the project to run you first need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). The project requires `browserify` and `watchify` to work in development.

After installing Node run `npm install` in the project root folder to install those dependencies. 
Alternatively you can also install `browserify` and `watchify` globally.

### Build
To create the compiled version of all the project's Javascript run `npm run build-js` in the root. It also possible to continuously compile the Javascript by running `npm run watch-js`.
